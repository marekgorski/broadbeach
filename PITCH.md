#Broadbeach Pitch

##Problem
In the last 10 years, **6% of Australian adults**, who used to donate to charities, have stopped. One of the main reasons for this behaviour was cited as the lack of transparency around the spending of raised funds.

As the total donations in 2016 were $11.2 billion dollars, this equates to a $600 million dollar problem.


##Solution
Our solution includes an app, that allows you to **actively manage your donation portfolio**. This effectively increases the transparency around both raised funds and their allocations. We give users the option to actively participate in what they donate towards, while also providing a default (generic) option which is based on calculated averages.

The use of a smart contract solution helps reduce friction on all donations and activities that spawn from it. It allows us to track, measure and reward active participants. It also gives participants the ability to pledge funds towards specific projects they believe in.


You get to load up your app with your donation amount - then you allocate the funds to either your selected project, or a passive portfolio option. You can think of this being like a mutual fund / superannuation (actively manage your donation portfolio)


##Demo
* Alice (clean the beach)
* Belinda (clean the ocean)
* Bob's allocation 60/40 (passive)
* Adam's allocation (active)



##Opportunity
We believe that creating additional transparency around the gathering, allocation and spending of funds would both increase interest in volunteering efforts but also increase donations by at least 5% per year.


##Roadmap
1. Local people get connected (Volunteer time, Raise issues, Coordinate efforts)
2. Rewards are issued for contributions
3. Bring large initiative opportunities for change

##Go to market
To limit the required effort from WWF and to run a contained pilot, we suggest an initiative program to protect both land and sea around the Broadbeach QLD region.
